# Copyright Free Boombox

Copyright Free Boombox removes the copyrighted track from the possible boombox tracks.

Note: To be as future-proof as possible, tracks are marked as "copyright free", and all others are removed - if a new track is added this mod assumes it is copyrighted and removes it, until the source is manually changed.
